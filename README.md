# Some Useful Reminders

> When you add a string with a number, JS automatically converts the number into a string. This is called type coercion. 
- For calculations involving money, always do it in cents and then convert it to dollars by dividing by 100

- Escape character(\') -  used when you have a single quote before the end of the string for example: 
'i\'m learning JS'
